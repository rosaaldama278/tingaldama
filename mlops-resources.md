### MLOps resources

[github] [MLOps-Basics](https://github.com/graviraja/MLOps-Basics): It includes the basics of MLOps like model building, monitoring, configuration, testing, packaging, deployment, cicd, etc.

[book] [Machine Learning Engineering in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Engineering-Action-Wilson/dp/1617298719/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SKUQICI0WYM7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jkClncXyWj6mHQlmY0EfUKw3YgOZgUamqmEnvu-jyLVP2gWY85sTH1Xxj1-WK1b5ZM2hlWjlqBXoAJl-r0oSn4EKkLjJg5winA8kUFYsrj4ireCGyN0RbV0MuHx9OEiZ1BYNfSZDNbmBixkpSvgHNL_l1GKhMJCpBVIu5m6kpehiao5Xt0qXc6DzpBnKo25hbVImhqhlT6GaXG-a_qtoDUGz72tgTZ5RlYxQrE1Y59c.PHJAneIALrNSEfr05jP1PdMYjGAhsNUISj42T4bwjVQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=machine+learning+engineering+in+action&qid=1719356379&sprefix=machine+learning+engineering+%2Caps%2C129&sr=8-1): This book is from a machine learning engineer with decades of experience in the industry. He indentifies the real worls obstacles when it comes to machine learning engineering, core principle and best practices for designing, building, and delivering successful machine learning projects.


### Gen AI

[website] [LLM Visualization](https://bbycroft.net/llm): This project displays a 3D model of a working implementation of a GPT-style network. That is, the network topology that's used in OpenAI's GPT-2, GPT-3, (and maybe GPT-4)
